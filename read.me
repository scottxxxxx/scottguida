# Hey, I'm Scott Guida

**AI Architect | Head of AI Experiences | Building Agentic Systems That Ship**

I build production AI systems that actually work in the real world. 25+ years in tech, the last 7 focused on transforming how enterprises use AI, from Fortune 500 conversational platforms to multi agent orchestration systems handling millions of interactions.

Currently leading AI Experiences at [Kore.ai](https://kore.ai), where I architect LLM powered platforms for healthcare and financial services clients.

### What I'm Building

- **Agentic AI systems** using LangGraph and LangChain with multi agent orchestration for complex enterprise workflows
- **Production RAG architectures** with Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma that go beyond demo quality
- **Zero shot intent classification** systems that eliminated the need for training datasets in healthcare NLU
- **RedGuard** — an AI security framework for testing and hardening LLM powered applications

### Tech I Work With Daily

```
LLMs & Agents    │  GPT-4, Claude, Gemma, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP
ML Frameworks    │  PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face
Vector & Search  │  Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS
Backend          │  Python, FastAPI, Node.js, WebSocket
Frontend         │  React, TypeScript
Cloud & MLOps    │  AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, CI/CD
Data             │  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka
```

### Career Highlights

**Head of AI Experiences (AX)** — Kore.ai *(2024 – Present)*
Took conversational AI platforms from sub 20% containment to 40%+ for Fortune 500 clients by replacing deterministic dialog flows with LLM powered agents. Built the LangChain + LangGraph framework that now powers our enterprise deployments.

**ML Architect** — ServiceNow *(2022 – 2024)*
Led a team of 5 ML engineers building healthcare AI systems. Engineered PyTorch models for medical document extraction (95% accuracy), built HIPAA compliant RAG pipelines, and reduced LLM hallucination rates by 64%.

**Principal ML Architect** — Infosys *(2018 – 2022)*
Designed and deployed conversational AI across banking, telecom, and insurance. Built systems serving 15M+ customers with measurable reductions in call handling time and agent transfers.

### Certifications

CISSP · IBM Certified AI Specialist · Kore AI Advanced Developer · UIPath Solution Architect · Microsoft MCSE · Cisco CCNP

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in talking about agentic AI architectures, production ML systems, and the intersection of LLMs with enterprise software.
